            <h3 class = "description"> Description </h3>
            <p> I am a BSCS Student at the University of the Immaculate Conception. An anime enthusiast; I particularly enjoy the refreshing genres of romantic comedy and slice of life. I take a liking into video editing, as well. Gaming is a huge part of my lifeâ€”playing Valorant and Genshin Impact (with my friends) frequently help relieve my stress.
            </p>
