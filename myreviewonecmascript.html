        <p>In the year 1995, a person named Brendan Eich was given a task to design and develop a prototype and a programming language for the web browser for Netscape Navigations. He came up with an initial draft in just 10 days and later on that initial draft would somewhat conquer the world of web development. The draft was called mocha when it was first released but in the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, it was renamed to livescript and in Netscape Navigator 3.0 it was renamed again to JavaScript. It was renamed as JavaScript to come and lure java developers to come and develop on the web browser. The lure was to make the java developers feel more at home when developing. 
           <br> Microsoft did not want to lose the browser battle to Netscape and released their own programming languages VBScript and JScript. To bring stability to the situation, in 1996 Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA international in order to define standards to be implemented which could then be shared to other browser vendors so they can implement similar functionalities. The standardization and organization led to the release of ECMAScript on June 1997 in the ECMA-262 standard release and after that, it led to the many version releases of ECMAScript.

        <p>Vanilla JavaScript is using JavaScript without ever having to use any libraries or frameworks. 
            <br>The Word Vanilla means boring, bland, and normal.

        <p> We can see the search history of JavaScript from 2004 to the present slowly decreasing in searches and that Python is slowly rising in searches.<br> To sum it up, this video summarizes the search history of the popular programming languages used by programmers.</p>
